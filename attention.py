Betty needs $100 for the wallet. She has half of that, which is $50. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice that amount, which is $30. So, Betty receives $15 + $30 = $45 from her parents and grandparents. Adding this to the $50 she already has gives her $50 + $45 = $95. Therefore, she needs $100 - $95 = $5 more to buy the wallet.
     
Julie read 12 pages yesterday. She read twice as many pages today, which is 12*2=24. So she has read 12+24=36 pages already. She has 120-36=84 remaining pages. Half of this is 42. So Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.
